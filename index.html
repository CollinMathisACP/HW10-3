<h1>4 Elements of a Distribution</h1>
<h2>First, a Definition:</h2>
<p>The distribution is a visualization of how values occur relative to each other. It can be used to identify outliers and see how 
much the data varies, among other things.
</p>

<h2>Level</h2>
<p>
The level, or center, of a distribution can tell us a lot about data as a whole. The mode for example can help us see an unusually 
recurring value, which could be cause for further research. The mean and the median can give us an understanding of the data set’s 
middle values, and they can do even more when compared to each other. If the mean of a data set is much greater or lesser than the 
median, that could be an indication that there are outliers in either direction.
</p>

<h2>Spread</h2>
<p>The spread of a distribution is the degree to which the data deviates from some middle value. There are multiple measurements that 
are relevant to this. The most important is standard deviation. In short, the standard deviation measures the average distance between 
the data points and the mean. A low value indicates that most of the data points are close to the mean. A distribution with a low 
standard deviation would appear to have data points clumped around a single central value. Furthermore, standard deviation can be used 
to calculate a z-score. The z-score is a standardized value that measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the 
mean, in either the positive or negative direction.
</p>

<h2>Shape</h2>
<p>The shape of a distribution is the first thing one notices when looking at a histogram. Simply, it is the appearance of the data points 
as a whole. This has multiple attributes. For example, it can have a skew, that is, a cluster of data points on one end of the scale and 
then other data points that go towards the opposite end of the scale. One can also look for peaks, locations along the scale that have a 
high frequency of values.
</p>

<h2>Outliers</h2>
<p>Outliers can have many effects on a data set. First, it is important to understand resistant and nonresistant measures. The 
former, such as the mean, are heavily affected by outliers. The latter, such as the median, experience little to no effect. One 
data visualization that is particularly good at handling outliers is the box plot. In this chart, the 1st and 3rd quartiles are 
marked, as well as the median. This gives the reader a solid idea of the data’s center. It also displays outliers as dots on the 
far ends of the scale. This lets the reader see and interpret the presence of outliers without them affecting the rest of the data.
